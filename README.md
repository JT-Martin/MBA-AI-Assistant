# MBA AI Assistant

This is an AI assistant built for [LeadLaunch Systems](https://www.leadlaunchsystems.com) for their students to use. It uses the [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) framework with [React](https://reactjs.org/) as well as the [Vercel AI SDK](https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs) to interact with the [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com) in order to use GPT-4-Turbo. For styling I used [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com) because I wasn't using [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com) yet, if so I would have used Tailwind.
